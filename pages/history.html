    <h1>Some Background History (Land/Treaties/People)</h1>
<p>Native peoples have lived on this land since time immemorial. The unglaciated region of the Midwest - called the “Driftless” by many non-Native people - the Ho-Chunk call “the refuge,” for it was here where they survived the last Ice Age over thirteen thousand years ago.</p>
<h2>Ho Chunk</h2>
<p>The Ho-Chunk nation, who has been living in this region since time immemorial, faced removal throughout the 1800s, through what is known as the “trail of death,” no less than five times. </p>
<p>Some members of the Ho Chunk nation remained on a reservation in Nebraska to which they forcibly marched, where they are now known as the “Winnebego Nation of Nebraska.” Many other Ho Chunk resisted removal by repeatedly returning to Wisconsin. Because the Ho-Chunk persisted in their resistance and continued to return to Wisconsin, in 1881, Congress finally passed special legislation allowing the Wisconsin Ho-Chunk forty-acre homesteads. Native historian Patty Loew writes, “Although the lands were inferior, most Ho-Chunk eked out an existence hunting, gathering, fishing, and gardening and occasionally hiring themselves out as farmhands.” The Ho Chunk remain in Wisconsin today. </p>
<h2>Meskwaki and Sauk</h2>
<p>In the early 1700s, fleeing the attempted genocide of their people by the French further east, the Sauk and Meskwaki found a homeland along the Upper Mississippi, where they mined and established villages. 
In 1804, William Henry Harrison (later the 9th president of the United States) tricked a delegation of five Sauk and Meskwaki people - none of whom had the authority of their nations to sign treaties, and all of whom he plied with liquor - into signing a treaty that “relinquished forever” all their land east of the Mississippi. For signing away 50 million acres, the nations received $2,000 in goods, and were promised an annual payment of $1,000. 
Of this fraudulent “treaty” the Sauk leader Black Hawk would later write, “I will leave it to the people of the United States to say whether our nation was properly represented in this treaty. Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded.”
A decade later, following the War of 1812, white Americans in search of lead descended into this region. By 1825, 10,000 miners had illegally invaded the region. </p>
<p>In 1830, Andrew Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act, demanding that all Native Nations living east of the Mississippi move west. Emboldened by this Act, as well as by the fraudulent treaty of 1804, white settlers felt entitled to Native land. Black Hawk, after returning to his village of Saukenauk (currently Rock Island) after hunting in central Iowa, reported that “...three families of whites had arrived at our village and destroyed some of our lodges and were making fences and dividing our corn fields for their own use… I went to my lodge and saw a family occupying it. I wished to talk with them but they could not understand me… the greater part of our corn-fields had been enclosed… What <em>right</em> had these people to our village, and our fields, which the Great Spirit had given us to live upon?”
Black Hawk and others resisted this flagrant land theft. The Sauk refused to leave their homes, land, and fields. In 1832, in what is known as the Black Hawk war, he and his group were chased north into Wisconsin for 16 weeks. Though they repeatedly tried to surrender, in August 1832 the US militia massacred 150 men, women, and children as they tried to cross the Mississippi River near the town now named “Victory.” </p>
<p>In the wake of the massacre, the Meskwaki and Sauk, including those living in what is now Dubuque, were pushed further west and forced to sign the so-called “Black Hawk Purchase” in which the US government grabbed six millions acres of land for just 11 cents an acre.
In 1857, a few Meskwaki and Sauk snuck back into Iowa and purchased 80 acres of land in what is now Tama, Iowa. The Meskwaki and Sauk now own this land, the only Indian settlement in the country, which now encompasses more than 8,000 acres. There they are reintroducing bison, establishing food sovereignty programs, and revitalizing their language. </p>
<h2>Colonization and Climate Change in Iowa</h2>
<p>Through ecological disruption, destruction of healthy soil, displacement of Native and Black people, forced labor, and attempted genocide, it is clear that <strong>colonization and racial oppression lie at the root of today’s climate crisis.</strong> </p>
<p>Robin Wall Kimmerer writes in Braiding Sweetgrass, “It all got “broke” at the same time — the prairie, the treaties, and the relationship between people and land…Between 1800 and 1930, 95% of the world’s Tallgrass prairie was converted to farmland… What took 12,000 years to become rich with thousands of species, took only 120 years to turn into an ecological desert, composed essentially of two species: corn and soybeans.”</p>
<p>Before 1800, more than 60 million bison roamed the land. Bison played a vital role in maintaining prairie and thriving ecosystems, as well as sinking carbon into the soil. Yet when Indigenous people resisted their forced relocation to reservations - in reality open-air prisons - U.S. cavalrymen began to intentionally destroy the buffalo herds on which Native people depended for food and survival in order to force submission. By the late 1870s, 5,000 bison were being killed every day. In Iowa, by 1870, no bison remained. </p>
<p>In Iowa, due to colonial agriculture, nearly seven inches of nutrient-rich topsoil has been lost to erosion since 1850. The water in more than half the state’s lakes and rivers is unsuitable for swimming, fishing, or drinking. Over 20,000 square miles are planted with nothing other than corn. Native prairie now stands in less than a half of 1 percent of its precolonial existence. </p>
<p>The Honor Native Land Fund is one small step toward repair of this harm. HNLF provides the opportunity for non-Native people living in Iowa and Wisconsin to contribute money on an ongoing basis to the <a href="https://www.greatplainsaction.org/">Great Plains Action Society</a>, an Indigenous-led organization made up of Meskwaki, Ho Chunk, Ioway, and other Indigenous people who seek to purchase land outside of Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, in order to “resist colonization and to re-indigenize the world around us.”</p>
